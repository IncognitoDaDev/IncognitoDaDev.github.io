            <div class="MainSelectionSubDiv">
                <p1>This is a C++ project made to simulate and solve Rubik Cubes in console.</p1>

                <p1>
                    The idea of creating this project was firstly suggested to me by a mentor during a robotics
                    competition
                    named FTC organized by the organizators of FIRST as an attempt to improve my coding capabilities
                    and have something to show during my time in robotics. Two years later of hesistation, I have given
                    it a try. 
                </p1>

            <div class="MainChapter">
                <h2>How I made it</h2>
            </div>

            <div class="MainSelectionDiv">
                <p1>
                    The code is split in 4 scripts <i>(main.cpp, RubikCube.cpp, AStarSearch.cpp, PuzzleState.cpp, all
                    made from scratch)</i>
                    This section will be split in 3 subchapters: <b>Reading and Hashing, Rotating the Rubik Cube,
                    Solving using A* Star</b>
                </p1>

                <h3>Reading and Hashing</h3>

            <div class="MainSelectionSubDiv">
                <p1>
                    The first thing you'll find yourself asking when it comes to reading and hashing a rubik cube is...
                    <b>how do I save all of the information that describle the color and the way is facing?</b>
                    <br> It is quite a tricky question to answer...
                </p1>
                // Insert here picture of describling the way data is being handled
                <p1>
                    My solution consists of making a list of 6 integer matrices, sized 3 by 3.
                    6 matrices, one for every face, that have their integers reflecting what color it is.
                    <i>For example, we asociate the color WHITE with 0, Blue with 1 and so on...</i>
                    <br>
                    <br> But all of that isn't enough, we need to also know where are the faces facing...
                    The rubik cube is defined under 6 orientations (Front, Back, Up, Down, Left, Right).
                    That means we'll have to create a list that remembers the faces' orientation.
                    <br> // Insert here code that defines direction
                    <br> Congratulations! We now can hash all of the information that a rubik can offer!
                    (and read it into console)
                </p1>
            </div>

            <div class="MainSubchapter">
                <h3>Rotating the Rubik Cube</h3>
            </div>

            <div class="MainSelectionSubDiv">
                <p1>
                    Yay, we can now read the rubik, but... how can we play it?
                    <br>Oh boy... This is now where <i>things get tricky really... fast.</i>
                    <br><br>Lets understand our problem by rephrasing the question: how do we make a turn on the rubik?
                    <br>A turn of the rubik cube implies turning 9 cubies (a rubik cube is made
                    out of 26 cubies where a cubie represents one of smaller cubes) which means turning one of 3x3
                    matrices by 90 degrees.
                    <br><br>But that is not enough since we only turned a face <i>but not its neighboor faces.</i> So we
                    turn our attention
                    to the variable that remembers every face's orientation and switch the colors between the neighboor
                    faces in a roundabout pattern.
                </p1>

                // Insert here a disected rubik cube

                <p1>Cool! Lets see all of this in code now!</p1>

                // Insert here less complicated code

                <p1>
                    All that's left now is to make a way to input our moves!
                    <br><br> For simplicity, we create a function that takes the following variables: 
                    the 6 faces of the rubik cube, their orientation, if is it clockwise or anticlockwise and how many 90 degrees turns.

                    <br> This will be our function to call when we want to make a certain turn.
                    <br><br> Again, for simplicity, we create a function that asks for a character, if its a anticlockwise turn and how many 90 degrees turn.
                    This same function will determine where our turn will take place depending on the switch cases. Effectively translating the letters into
                    certain turns of our choice. Lets try typing in F!
                </p1>

                // input code

                <p1>
                    Great! Lets try typing in B!
                </p1>
                // Insert here failed output
                <p1>
                    Only if it was that simple...
                    <br><br> To explain better our problem: if we attempt a B rotation, it will not choose the edges its
                    suppose to turn as <b>every edge is unique to the face that is being turned</b>.
                    <br><br> This problem is solved by making a function that tries to reorganize the faces in a way
                    that the face we want to make a turn on is the front face then reverse the orientations back to their
                    original. This also means rotating the faces to match with the new orientation. 
                </p1>
                // Where's my switch-a-ton?!
                <p1>
                    Lets give it a run!
                </p1>
                // Console with good result
                <p1>
                    Its a working rubik cube simulator!
